# Instructions

### Demo 1 Declaring and Initializing Arrays
- Create a new file called InitArray1.java
- In this file, create a class named InitArray1
- Add a main method
    - Declare an int array variable 
    - Initialize the array object with a length of 10
    - Print a line in the console to display column headings
    - Use a for loop to iterate through the positions of the array and print counter, and value in the corresponding position in the array
- Create a new file called InitArray2.java
- In this file, create a class named InitArray2
- Add a main method
    - Declare an int array variable 
    - Initialize the array object by providing a list of values
        - List must be a enclosed in curly brackets
        - Each element is separate by a comma
        - Initializer list specifies the initial value for each element position
    - Print a line in the console to display column headings
    - Use a for loop to iterate through the positions of the array and print counter, and value in the corresponding position in the array
- Create a new file called InitArray3.java
- In this file, create a class named InitArray3
- Add a main method
    - Declare a final int variable and set value to 10
    - Declare an int array variable 
    - Initialize the array object and use the final int variable declared above to set the length
    - Use a for loop to iterate through the positions of the array
        - Each time, set the value of the corresponding position to 2 + 2 * counter
    - Print a line in the console to display column headings
    - Use a for loop to iterate through the positions of the array and print counter, and value in the corresponding position in the array

### Demo 2 Calculating the sum of the elements of an array
- Create a new file called SumArray.java
- In this file, create a class named SumArray
- Add a main method
    - Declare and initialize an int array of 10 elements
    - Declare an int variable named total and set value to 0, this will be used to keep sum amount
    - Use a for loop to iterate through the positions of the array
        - Each time, add the value in the current position of the array to the total
    - Print the total

### Demo 3 Card Shuffling and Dealing Simulation
- Create a new file called Card.java
- In this file, create a class named Card
    - Add two instance variables:
        - Face of type string and final
        - Suit of type string and final
    - Add a two-argument constructor that initializes card's face and suit
    - Add a helper method named ToString() which returns a string
        - Return the concatenation of face and suit
- Create a new file called DeckOfCards.java
- In this file, create a class named DeckOfCards
    - Add two instance variables:
        - Secure random object
        - Constant containing number of cards with value set to 52
        - Array of cards named Deck and initialized to an array of 52 cards
        - Int variable named current card with value set to 0 which will keep the index of the card that's currently being dealt
    - Add a constructor method without parameters and returning void
        - Declare an array of strings which contains face values: Ace to King
        - Declare an array of suits which contains suit values: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades
        - Use a for loop to iterate through each position of the deck array
            - Each time, generate a new card object and set suit and face value randomly
                - faces[count % 13]
                - suits[count / 13]
            - Store this card object in the corresponding position of the deck array
    - Add a helper method called Shuffle without parameters
        - Set current card value to 0, this means the card at the very top of the deck is being picked
        - Use a for loop to iterate through each position of the deck array
            - Each time, generate a random number between 0 and 51
            - Swap current card with the card at the randomly generated position
    - Add a helper method named DealCard without parameters and returning a Card object
        - Using and if statement
            - Determine whether Cards remain to be dealt
                - In which case, return the card from the deck at the current position
                - Increase the current card counter variable by 1
            - If there are no more cards
                - Deck is considered empty when counter reached 52
                - Return null
- Create a new file called DeckOfCardsTest.java
- In this file, create a class named DeckOfCardsTest
- Add a main method
    - Declare and initialize an object of type DeckOfCards
    - Call the shuffle method
    - Use a for each loop to iterate 52 times
        - Print all 52 Cards in the order in which they are dealt
        - Call dealCard method
        - Print card value
        - Output a newline after every fourth card

### Demo 4 Finding the maximum value of three double parameters
- Create a new file called EnhancedForTest.java
- In this file, create a class named EnhancedForTest
- Add a main method
    - Declare and initialize an int array of 10 elements
    - Declare an int variable named total and set value to 0, this will be used to keep sum amount
    - Use a foreach loop to iterate through each element in the array
        - Note the different syntax
        - There's no need to keep a counter in the foreach loop
        - Each time, add the value in the current position of the array to the total
    - Print the total
