# Instructions

### Demo 1 Creating a Time Class
- Create a new file called Time1.java
- In this file, create a class named Time1
- Declare three private instance variables with datatype int for storing the time:
    - Hour
    - Minute
    - Second
- Add a set method called setTime which accepts three parameters: hour, minute, and second
    - Use an if-else statement to validate that
        - Hour is a number greater than 0 and lesser than or equal to 24
        - Minute is a number greater than or equal to 0 and lesser than 60
        - Second is a number greater than or equal to 0 and lesser than 60
    - Set each instance variable value to the corresponding value from the method parameter list
- Add a helper method named toUniversalString without parameters that returns a string
    - Return string representing the current time as universal-time format H:MM:SS
- Add a helper method called toString() without parameters that returns a string
    - Return string representing the current time as standard-time format  H:MM:SS AM or PM

- Add a main method
    - Declare and initialize an instance of Time1
    - Print the time after the object was created in the terminal
    - Call setTime with parameters 13, 30, 6
    - Print the time in the terminal again
    - Add a try-catch block
        - In the try block, call setTime with incorrect values: 99,99,99

- Add an additional constructor method that accepts 1 parameters: hour
    - Call the constructor method with three parameter passing the corresponding values for hour, and passing 0 for minute and second
- Add a helper method named toUniversalString without parameters that returns a string
    - Return string representing the current time as universal-time format H:MM:SS
- Add a helper method called toString() without parameters that returns a string
    - Return string representing the current time as standard-time format  H:MM:SS AM or PM
- Create a new file called Time2Test.java
- In this file, create a class named Time2Test
- Add a main method
    - Declare and initialize an instance of Time2 using the default constructor (no parameters)
    - Print the string value of this instance
    - Declare and initialize an instance of Time2 using the constructor with 1 parameter (hour value)
    - Print the string value of this instance
    - Declare and initialize an instance of Time2 using the constructor with 2 parameters (hour, minute)
    - Print the string value of this instance
    - Declare and initialize an instance of Time2 using the constructor with 3 parameters (hour, minute, second)
    - Print the string value of this instance
    - Declare and initialize an instance of Time2 using the constructor with 1 parameter (time object)
    - Print the string value of this instance
    - Add a try-catch block
        - In the try block, declare and initialize an instance of Time2 using the constructor with 3 parameters  passing incorrect values: 99,99,99
        - In the catch block, handle IllegalArgumentException, and print error message to the terminal

### Demo 4 Using Composition
- Create a new file called Date.java
- In this file, create a class named Date
