    - Add a method named MakeSound
        - No parameters
        - Returns void
        - Use keyword override
        - Write code to print the Bark bark
- Go to Program.cs > main method
    - Modify the default Console.WriteLine() message to read "Hello, Animals!"
    - Declare and initialize a new instance of Cat
    - Call MakeSound()
    - Declare and initialize a new instance of Dog
    - Call MakeSound()
- Run the program and verify output

### Demo 2 Interfaces (Contact Manager System)
